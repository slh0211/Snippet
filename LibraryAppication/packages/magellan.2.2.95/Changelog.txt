Magellan Changelog:
--------------------------------------

Below are the key highlights of changes that have been made to Magellan. See the subversion repository for a 
detailed history and prior versions (http://code.google.com/p/magellan-framework/source/checkout). 

2011-02-01:
  - Support for nested INavigators and navigator state
  - NuGet package

2010-08-31: 
  - Published a RubyGem - http://rubygems.org/gems/magellan-framework

2010-08-21:
  - Out of the box support for Data Annotations in Magellan Forms.
  - .NET 4.0 client profile compatability.
  - Zones are now freezables rather than ContentControls, to keep things lighter and have less visual tree 
    wierdness.

2008-08-05:
  - RedirectResult and BackResult use dispatcher, so they'll work with AsyncController now
  - Extensions will now be packaged into their own project

2008-07-28:
  - Moved to Google Code (http://code.google.com/p/magellan-framework)

2010-06-04:
  - Split RouteCollection into RouteResolver and RouteCatalog, to make creating a set of routes with the same 
    handler much easier.
  - Enabled ability to navigate using a lambda expression - e.g.,:
      Navigator.Navigate<PatientController>(x => x.Search("Hello"));
    Which is the same as:
      Navigator.Navigate(new {controller = "Patient", action = "Search", text = "Hello"});

2010-06-02:
  - NavigateCommand has been removed. Views or view models should implement INavigationAware, or the Blend 
    NavigateAction should be used.

2010-05-30:
  - Routing and the NavigatorFactory now take centre stage.
  - Better support for multiple frames of navigation.
  - Exceptions thrown by controllers are no longer wrapped by UnhandledActionException. However, async 
    requests (with AsyncActionInvoker) will still be wrapped to allow the exception to dispatch onto the UI 
    thread.
  - Models are passed direct to action results (e.g., return Page("MyPage", new FooModel())) rather than 
    using a Model property.

2010-05-02:
  - Introduced a routing engine, similar to ASP.NET MVC's

2010-02-20:
  - Introduced a dynamic data inspired Forms system. See this page for details:
    http://www.paulstovell.com/magellan-forms

2010-02-19:
  - Bug fix: Zones in a shared layout can now contain element bindings (a bug with name scoping previously 
    prevented this)
  - Bug fix: Model binders now resolve derived types (e.g., you can register a model binder for IFoo, and it 
    will be resolved for Foo)

2010-01-28:
  - Initial Silverlight port (Silverlight support is still experimental)
  - Controller methods are all virtual

2010-01-26:
  - Migration to CodePlex.
  - Introduced NavigateWithTransitionAction, as an alternative to the behavior (via Caleb Vear).
  - Introduced an IViewNamespaceProvider interface, to encapsulate project structure conventions from view 
    engines (via Caleb Vear).
  - Behaviors are now [Obsolete], please switch to the trigger actions instead. I plan to delete the 
    behaviors in a few months. 

2010-01-15:
  - Added a strong name key

2010-01-03:
  - Changed Zone.ZoneName to Zone.ZonePlaceHolderName, and ZonePlaceHolder.ZoneName to ZonePlaceHolder.Name
  - Enabled nested layouts - see http://www.paulstovell.com/magellan-shared-layouts for details.
    
2010-01-01:
  - Added Master Page support
  - Fixed a bug to do with parameter evaluation in the Navigate behavior
  - Added a "Wizard" sample

2009-12-30:
  - Added deeper tracing support. See this post for more details: 
    http://www.paulstovell.com/magellan-diagnostics

2009-12-29:
  - Implemented support for asynchronous controllers.
  - Changed how controller factories are implemented to make disposal/release management easier when custom
    factories are used.

2009-12-22:
  - Added the INavigationAware interface, which can be implemented by views and models that wish to know 
    about the current navigation request.
  - Reusing the logic in ViewEngineResult-derived classes for WPF by creating a base class called
    FrameworkElementViewEngineResult.

2009-12-21:
  - Changes to how prefixes/suffixes are added to views in the ReflectionBasedViewEngine. 

2009-12-11:
  - When returning a Page() result from a Controller, an additional overload is now the ability to reset 
    navigation history (clearing all 'Back' entries from the navigation journal).
  - Instead of throwing a NavigationException and relying on the message, NavigationException is now abstract 
    and all exceptions derive from it. Existing exception handling code should still work but you can also 
    now handle more explicit exceptions - e.g., ActionNotFoundException, ViewNotFoundException, 
    UnhandledActionInvocationException, and so on.

2009-12-09:
  - Fixed a bug in RedirectResult where it always used Navigator.Default rather than the navigator serving 
    the request.
  - Added a lot of tests; Magellan now has 100% coverage.
  - Added a 'return StartProcess("calc.exe")' for controllers, with the optional ability to wait for the 
    process to exit.

2009-12-07:
  - Implemented support for result filters.
  - Cleaned up action filter API.

2009-12-05:
  - Changed "View()" to "Window()", "Page()" and "Dialog()" to make controller returns more clear. 
    See this page for details: http://www.paulstovell.com/magellan-view-return-values.
  - Included XML comments in builds.
  - Corrected the project template so that dependencies are only copied if requested.

2009-11-27:
  - Added a 'Back()' action result which allows controllers to return to the previous page. 

2009-11-15:
  - Created an MSI and project templates.
  - Introduced this changelog.

2009-11-14:
  - XAML namespace has been changed from http://magellan-project.org to http://xamlforge.com/magellan - I did 
    not realise this domain was taken.
  - Navigation requests don't require a navigation service.
  - Navigation requests now have ActionParameters and ContextParameters. ActionParameters are for the action 
    method arguments, and ContextParameters
    are used by the navigation infrastructure.
  - Transitions have been moved to a different library.
